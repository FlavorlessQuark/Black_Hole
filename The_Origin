This is all that I know as of now and that I can write. I keep this as a reference for the future, on what I have learned.


1 - We do not know what the Big Bang is. I have read Many theories, though most of them describe the instang after the BigBang, as time and physics break down at the very beginning, it is impossible to describe
how it started.
My favorite theory is one whose name I cannot remember. It states that the end of the Universe is essentially the same as its beginning. When all has decayed and become uniform, there is no telling whether the universe is millions of light years wide or
if it is as small as a pea. And so in this way, the beginning of a universe is akin to the end of another.

2 - States. Particles cannot be in the same state.

3 - Gravity is not a force. It is the curvature of SpaceTime. But if it is so, then why the talks about the speed of the gravitaitonal force?

4 - An object in motion stays in motion. And object at rest stays at rest. Unless a force is applied to it.

5 - Everything is relative.

6 - Matter is made up of Quarks. They come in 6 flavors (3 pairs) Up and Down, Strange and Charm, Top and Bottom

7 - Mass is given by interaction with the Higss field. It is a scalar field. Without this interaction , all prticles would be massless and thus would travel at the speed of light.

8 -
