	- With Tiles I hope to be able to make a simple function which tells me what part of the screen has been clicked, and which button this corresponds to.
My main problem is that I am very reluctant to loop trough every object on the screen in order to find which has been hit.
I think the best solution to these kind of problems is to divide the screen in a grid, each square pointing to an array of button pointers in the grid.
I am not sure that this is the optimal solution but maybe a step in the right direction? With this I would still need to iterate through every
button in the grid square, as well as allocate sufficient memory for each and every grid square. Taking all of this into account, would it be
faster /better to only iterate trough all of the object? I think it would be, at least memory wise only up to a certain number of objects...That number is unknown to me...

Maybe I can instead have a sorted array / list and store its median so I can know which half to search? This would still be relatively slow given a large enough amount of numbers.
It is always a tradeoff between speed and memory.
