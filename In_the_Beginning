This is all that I know as of now and that I can write. I keep this as a reference for the future, on what I have learned.


1 - We do not know what the Big Bang is. I have read Many theories, though most of them describe the instang after the BigBang, as time and physics break down at the very beginning, it is impossible to describe
how it started.
My favorite theory is one whose name I cannot remember. It states that the end of the Universe is essentially the same as its beginning. When all has decayed and become uniform, there is no telling whether the universe is millions of light years wide or
if it is as small as a pea. And so in this way, the beginning of a universe is akin to the end of another.

2 - States. Particles cannot be in the same state.

3 - Gravity is not a force. It is the curvature of SpaceTime. But if it is so, then why the talks about the speed of the gravitaitonal force?

4 - An object in motion stays in motion. And object at rest stays at rest. Unless a force is applied to it.

5 - Everything is relative.

6 - Matter is made up of Quarks. They come in 6 flavors (3 pairs) Up and Down, Strange and Charm, Top and Bottom

7 - Mass is given by interaction with the Higss field. It is a scalar field. Without this interaction , all prticles would be massless and thus would travel at the speed of light.

8 - It is harder to write what you know when you are actively trying to recall it.

9 - Black holes emit radiation. I think there are many explanations for this but the one I remembered was that, virtual particules are always being created and destroyed. But near a black hole it can happen that
one of the virtual particles falls beneath the even horizon and it's counterpart is left to wander the universe. When a pair of virtual particles apear, they "borrow" energy from the universe, only to give it back when they disapear. However if they don't disapear, they cant put back the energey and so it has ot be permanently taken from somewhere
and that somewehre is the black hole in which half of the pari fell.

10 - We are not in fact the center of the universe.
