I wish to become proficient at C, though I have recently learned that knowing other languages helps you become a better programmer. I think I will start with LISP.
For now I don't really understand how programming languages differ from each other but I hope to learn this soon.
I think I will also learn Go or Rust, at least the basics. As well as some Perl, HTML and maybe the basics of Java as well. I will also try to get a better understanding of C++ and Python.

I am also looking to do some security projects, and learn more assembly in the process.
Though at the moment I prefer doing Graphics projects in C, I will complete the Tiles and Obj_Renderer projects before getting into these  other languages.

Here I will record what I have learned about these languages and how they help me be better at C
