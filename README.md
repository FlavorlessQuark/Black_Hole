# Black_Hole
Information is never lost, even in the most warped of SpaceTimes

## Do not cross the Event_Horizon

- Here I will keep track of my projects and the knowledge that come with their completion, as well as the observations and reflections I have had while making them.

 - From colliding balls to entire universes, I will also write about the projects I wish to accomplish and what I hope to learn from them.
This will be done in chapters, quanta by quanta, until I have absorbed any and all knowledge.

---

- Time contains a log of all my projects and the reason why they came into being/ what I learned from them. From AUG 2020 onwards

- Quarks: The building blocks. The languages I learned and what is important about them. I think they each teach a different aspect of programming, that may or may not be relevant to other languages.

- Information: Important non language specific stuff I leaned. The general stuff like " Don't do 4 billion calls to sys()"

Like a black hole
