Every byte of code brings us closer

Every line makes us stronger

Every file takes us farther

--------------------------------
 Getting good - Bigger projects I want to accomplish -
 
 - [ ] Rendering engine
 - [X] Make a website
 - [ ] Robots!
 - [ ] Physics!
 - [ ] Make a game
 - [ ] Complete Wrapper for SDL2
 - [ ] Make a programming language
 - [ ] Make an OS
 - [ ] Get on AoC leaderboard
 - [ ] Find the answer to life, the universe and everything


## Do not cross the Event_Horizon.

From colliding balls to entire universes, I will code many projects and seek the understanding that comes with them
This will be done, quanta by quanta, until I have absorbed any and all knowledge.
Like a black hole

**August 2020**

- Here starts the Journey. For now I am just a newborn. I do not know much nor do I know what I don't know. But line after line, I get better understanding of code..
This past month I have been focusing on Graphics projects, which are my favorited. Eventually I would like to write a game engine. But for now I need to build my skills.
SDL_Tools is a testimony of what I have learned, and I will upgrade it as time passes...

**October 2020**

- Back to C for advent of Code. I have completed the year 2015 last month and hope to complete 2016 and 2017 and even start on 2018 this month. The goal being to finish all years in time for AoC 2020...
It feels like an eon has passed by since August... it's only been a few months yet my comprehension of programming has greatly improved. There is still a mountain to climb, but with each step, the ascension becomes easier


**March 2021**

- Still here and still coding. My coding skills truly have improved since August, even though it's only  been 8 months, the change is very noticeable. Though I have sometimes struggled to solve some problems, I have never given up. I 've made projects that seemed impossible to me a short while ago. A raymarcher (barely functioning but still!). I've made a wraper around SDL that does automagic animations and input mapping! I've made fractals with Sine coloring! I even completed advent of code 2020, doing each problem as they came out and got on the learderboard once!

And now I think I want to build up a website that will contain small games I have made. I should make a new one every few weeks until I run out of ideas.
The slope gets steeper, but I shall be the very best and I shall keep climbing
Like no one ever was!

**June 2021**

- Failure is the greatest teacher, said someone, probably. Well, failed I have, and learn I must. I recently attempted to pass the Problem solving certification on Hackerrank. Well, I do think i was given somewhat hard problems... and these are not straight coding problems, rather, they require a bit of math. And though I like math I know nothing about it. Hence I have created Level_Up, which is a repository where I will collect all the problems which I have not or could not solve efficiently enough. I hpe to someday be able to slve similar problems with ease...
