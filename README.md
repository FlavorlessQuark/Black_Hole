# Black_Hole
Information is never lost, even in the most warped of SpaceTimes

## In short... do not cross the Event_Horizon.

- Here I will keep track of my projects and the knowledge that come with their completion, as well as the observations and reflections I have had while making them.

 - From colliding balls to entire universes, I will also write about the projects I wish to accomplish and what I hope to learn from them.
This will be done, quanta by quanta, until I have absorbed any and all knowledge.
Like a black hole

## Space and time

- **Time** contains a log of all my projects and the reason why they came into being/ what I learned from them. From AUG 2020 onwards

- **Quarks** The building blocks. The languages I learned and what is important about them. I think they each teach a different aspect of programming, that may or may not be relevant to other languages.

- **Information** Important non language specific stuff I leaned. The general stuff like " Don't do 4 billion calls to sys()"

## Gravity

**August 2020**

- Here starts the Journey. For now I am just a newborn. I do not know much nor do I know what I don't know. But line after line, I get better understanding of code.. 
This past month I have been focusing on Graphics projects, which are my favorited. Eventually I would like to write a game engine. But for now I need to build my skills.
SDL_Tools is a testimony of what I have learned, and will upgrade it as time passes...

**September 2020**

- I am taking a break from graphics project to work on Advent of code. A series of short problems. I originally wanted to learned as many langues as possible but I think I will focus on these four : Python, C, C++ and Assembly. For the kind of work I want to do in the future, I think they are the best suited.
As always I have recorded my progress in Python in Quarks.

**October 2020**

- Back to C for advent of Code. I have completed the year 2015 last month and hope to complete 2016 and 2017 and even start on 2018 this month. The goal being to finish all years in time for AoC 2020...
It feels like an eon has passed by since August... it's only been a few months yet my comprehension of programming has greatly impvoed. There is still a mountain to climb, but with each step, the ascension becomes easier
