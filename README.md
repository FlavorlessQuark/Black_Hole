# Black_Hole
Information is never lost, even in the most warped of SpaceTimes

## Do not cross the Event_Horizon

- Here I will keep track of my projects and the knowledge that come with their completion, as well as the observations and reflections I have had while making them.

 - From colliding balls to entire universes, I will also write about the projects I wish to accomplish and what I hope to learn from them.
This will be done in chapters, quanta by quanta, until I have absorbed any and all knowledge.

Like a black hole
